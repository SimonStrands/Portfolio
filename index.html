                Hello! My name is Simon Strand, I am 23 years olds and from Sweden, I like to code/program in C++, C#
                and Javascript, but I am also open to other languages.
                <br>
                I started coding in gymnasiet (16 years old), where we learned the basic, I fell in love with the
                problem solving and to create something.
                I then went to BTH, a university in Karlskrona (Sweden), where I was tought some of the more advanced
                things, such as making a simple Game Engine with DirectX 11 and Networking with sockets.
                I also like to create small application in Unity and SFML.
                <br>
                As a programmer I would like to solve problems while also creating something fun, visually cool or/and
                creative.
            </p>
            <h3 class="align_left">Outside Programming</h3>
            <p class="align_left">
                In addition to my passion for coding and problem solving, I have a diverse set of interests to keep me
                inspired.
                <br>
                <strong>Track and Field:</strong>
                Outside of programming I like to train and compete in track and field event such as 400m, discus, and
                more.
                <br>
                <strong>Video Games:</strong>
                I also like to play video games, such as league of legends, Tekken and more.

                        <strong>Presumed Dead</strong> is a school game project that me and seven other people worked
                        on.<br>
                        The game's goal is to kill monsters in the woods, gather perks and abilites, and find a portal
                        to go to the next level.<br>
                        I myself mainly worked on the network part of the game, being able to play up to four people,
                        using
                        both TCP and UDP protocol.<br>

                        the end there is a small mini game that
                        the player needs to complete before moving on to the next level.<br>

                        A game engine created in C++ and DirectX11.<br>
                        The engine uses multiple techniques such as:<br>
                        <strong>Deffered Rendering: </strong> To handle multiple dynamic lighs faster.<br>
                        <strong>Custom Obj File loader: </strong> The engine has an custom obj file loader that can load
                        different models and meshes
                        with different kind of materials.<br>
                        <strong>Displacement Mapping and level of detail using Tessellation Hardware: </strong> Based on
                        the cameras position, some objects will transform and get smoother edges or change the vertecies
                        position based on a height map.<br>
                        <strong>Dynamic Shadow Mapping: </strong> To create "realistic" shadows.<br>
                        <strong>Dynamic Cube mapping: </strong> Taking 6 screenshots of the scene each frame to create a 360Â° mirror of the scene <br>
                        <strong>View Frustum Culling using Quadtree: </strong> To cull away static objects that the camera is not looking at<br>
                        <strong>Small particle system: </strong> Using points in a vertecies buffer to create billboarded particles and a custom compute shader to update the position
                        of the particles to create a small particle system.

                        The Galaxy Shooter was my first game that I ever did.<br>
                        The game is about taking stars to get points, shoot enemies that tries to kill you and before
                        the timer runs out go to a reset station, the
                        reset station will then reset the timer and add points.<br>

                        Western Gold is my second game that I ever created (We where 2 people).<br>
                        The game goes out on getting the gold that is hidden in the world, however, the gold is heavily guarded by cowboys who patrol the area according to given schedules.
                        The player is armed with his trusty revolver with limited amounts of ammunition per level. The players revolver is loud however, and can attract enemies.
                        The player can instead throw bullets to distract the enemies and sneak past.<br>
                        The game code is avalible at <a href="https://github.com/SkitzFist/W_Gold">Github</a>.
